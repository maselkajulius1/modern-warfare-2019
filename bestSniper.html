        <h1>The best sniper rifles in COD Warzone</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>The 5 weapons shown bellow are what I believe are the best snipers in COD Warzone.</p>
        <p>These based off of both my opinion and the pure capability of the weapons.</p>
        <p>If you want to find some statistics on these weapons you can go to <a href="https://truegamedata.com/" target="blank">True game data</a></p>

        <h2>AX-50</h2>
        <p>The AX-50 is a decent sniper rifle, but has some problems. The first problem is that<br>
        it is one of the last Modern Warfare guns unlocked. Another problem with this thing is<br>
        that it seam to shoot perfectly straight with the default scope and reticle(to my knowledge).<br>
        The AX-50 does however have a high damage to the body and one shot head shots.<br>
        Its bullet velocity is pretty good as well.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>HDR</h2>
        <p>The HDR is quite the improvement from the AX-50 as it actually shoots straight and has a much<br>
        better bullet velcoity. </p>
