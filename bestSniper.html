        <h1>The best sniper rifles in COD Warzone</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>The 5 weapons shown below are what I believe are the best snipers in COD Warzone.</p>
        <p>These are based off of both my opinion and the pure capability of the weapons.</p>
        <p>If you want to find some statistics on these weapons you can go to <a href="https://truegamedata.com/" target="blank">True game data</a></p>

        <h2>5) AX-50</h2>
        <p>The AX-50 is a decent sniper rifle, but has some problems. The first problem is that<br>
        it is one of the last Modern Warfare guns unlocked. Another problem with this thing is<br>
        that it seam to shoot perfectly straight with the default scope and reticle(to my knowledge).<br>
        The AX-50 does however have a high damage to the body and one shot headshots.<br>
        Its bullet velocity is pretty good as well.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>4) HDR</h2>
        <p>The HDR is quite the improvement from the AX-50 as it actually shoots straight and has a much<br>
        better bullet velocity. It has the same damage to the chest as the AX-50 and has more damage<br>
        to the legs. It still has the one shot headshot as well. The main problem with the HDR is the very slow<br>
        ADS (aim down sight) speed.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>3) SPR-208</h2>
        <p>The SPR is a great pick for aggresive sniping. Its has good ADS speed, a lot of ADS benifiting<br>
        attachments, and the option of some clean iron sights. It has a decent bullet velocity, high<br>
        damage to the chest, and of course the usual ability to kill with a headshot.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>2) LW3 Tundra</h2>
        <p>The LW3 has an incredibly fast bullet velocity, to the point where it can be described a hitscan.<br>
        It also has a competing ADS speed and, as always, a one shot headshot capability</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>1) Kar 98k</h2>
        <p>The Kar98 is probably the best sniper in warzone. It is best for an aggresive playstyle<br>
        due to the amazing ADS speed. It has a very high body shot damage and once again has the ability<br>
        to headshot to instantly kill your opponent. The Kar98 also has a good bullet velocity that can<br>
        improved greatly with the correct attachments wrapping up this already awesome package.</p>
