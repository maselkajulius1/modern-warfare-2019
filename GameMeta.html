        <h1>The meta of COD Warzone</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>The meta of Warzone is slowly changing and with the cold war weapons still being balanced,<br>
        now is a time in which it is hard to figure out what to use. So I'm making this list to tell you<br>
        what's currently best in Warzone and what you should use.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Mac-10</h2>
        <p>The Mac-10 is probably the most obvious choice on this list. The Mac-10 has an insane TTK<br>
        (time to kill) and absolutly melts through enemies. It also has good mobility and smooth recoil<br>
        making it an all around amazing smg.</p>
